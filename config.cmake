# CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is commented out in order to allow for multi-configuration builds. It will
# automatically default to RelWithDebInfo if used in a single configuration build. Uncomment or
# override it only if you want a non-default single configuration build.

option(WITH_OMP "Whether OpenMP thread parallisation should be enabled" TRUE)

option(WITH_MPI "Whether DFTB+ should support MPI-parallelism" FALSE)
# If you build an MPI-parallised binary, consider to set WITH_OMP (OpenMP thread parallelisaton) to
# FALSE unless you want hybrid parallelisation (for experts only).

option(WITH_GPU "Whether DFTB+ should support GPU-acceleration" FALSE)
# For serial builds, the GPU support requires the MAGMA library. For MPI parallel builds it
# requires the ELSI library built with GPU support.

option(WITH_ELSI "Whether DFTB+ with MPI-parallelism should use the ELSI libraries" FALSE)
# Works only with MPI-parallel build. If WITH_GPU was selected above, the ELSI library must be
# enabled (and must have been built with GPU support).

option(WITH_TRANSPORT "Whether transport via libNEGF should be included." FALSE)
# Works only when building static libraries (see option BUILD_SHARED_LIBS)

option(WITH_POISSON "Whether the Poisson-solver should be included" ${WITH_TRANSPORT})
# The Poisson-solver is mostly used in transport calculations only. Enable this option
# if you want to use it in a non-transport build. Note, the Poisson-solver is not
# multi-instance safe and is therefore not allowed, if WITH_API (see below) is on.

option(WITH_TBLITE "Whether xTB support should be included via tblite." FALSE)

option(WITH_SOCKETS "Whether socket communication should be allowed for" FALSE)

option(WITH_ARPACK "Whether the ARPACK library should be included (needed for TD-DFTB)" FALSE)
# For MPI-parallel builds, the MPI-parallel version of ARPACK (PARPACK) must also be present if
# this options is turned on.

option(WITH_SDFTD3 "Whether the s-dftd3 library should be included" FALSE)

option(WITH_MBD "Whether DFTB+ should be built with many-body-dispersion support" FALSE)

option(WITH_PLUMED "Whether metadynamics via the PLUMED2 library should be allowed for" FALSE)

option(WITH_CHIMES "Whether repulsive corrections via the ChIMES library should be enabled" FALSE)

option(WITH_API "Whether public API should be included and the DFTB+ library installed" FALSE)
# Turn this on, if you want to use the DFTB+ library to integrate DFTB+ into other software
# packages. (Otherwise only a stripped down version of the library without the public API is built.)
# This will also install necessary include and module files and further libraries needed to link the
# DFTB+ library.

option(WITH_PYTHON "Whether the Python components of DFTB+ should be tested and installed" FALSE)
# Use this option to test and install the Python components of DFTB+. Note, that the Python API
# based tools will only be considered, if shared library bulding (BUILD_SHARED_LIBS) and support for
# the general API (WITH_API) and dynamic loading (ENABLE_DYNAMIC_LOADING) had been enabled.
# Otherwise only the file I/O based tools (dptools) will be tested and installed.

option(INSTANCE_SAFE_BUILD "Whether build should support concurrent DFTB+ instances" FALSE)
# Turn this on, if you want to create multiple concurrent DFTB+ instances **within one process** via
# the API. This option will ensure that only components without writable global variables are
# included in the build, so that multiple instances can safely coexist. There are components
# (e.g. Poisson, DFTD-D3, ARPACK) which can not be included if this option is on. Note, this option
# is not relevant for the standalone DFTB+ binary, only for the API (if WITH_API had been turned
# on).

option(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS "Whether the libraries built should be shared" FALSE)
# Turn this on, if the DFTB+ library (and other compiled libraries) should be shared libraries and
# dynamically linked to their applications. This results in smaller applications, but the libraries
# must be present at run-time (and the correct LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable must be set, so
# that they can be found by the operating system). If you want use the DFTB+ library from other
# software packages (see WITH_API option above), they may also require a shared library (e.g.
# calling DFTB+ functions from Python or Julia). Note, that in order to use the library from Python
# and Julia, you also need to turn on the ENABLE_DYNAMIC_LOADING option.

option(ENABLE_DYNAMIC_LOADING "Whether the library should be dynamically loadable" FALSE)
# Turn this on, if you wish to load the library dynamically (typically when you want to use
# the library from Python or Julia). Only makes sense in combination with BUILD_SHARED_LIBS and
# WITH_API set to True.

# to 1 (see above) to avoid false positives triggered by the threading library.

# the specified order. Following methods are available:
#
# Submodule: Use the source in external/*/origin and build the dependency as part of the build
#     process. If the source is not present, try to retrieve it via the 'git submodule' command
#     (provided the source tree is a git repository and git is available)
#
# Find: Find the dependency as an already installed package in the system.
#
# Fetch: Fetch the source into the build folder and build the dependency as part of the build
#     process (works also in cases where the source tree is not a Git repository)

option(LCOV_REPORT "Whether coverage report should be generated via lcov/genhtml" FALSE)
# Makes only sense for build type 'Coverage'. Requires lcov and and optionally genhtml to be
# installed on the system. After building the code, you have to build manually the 'lcov_init'
# target (e.g. `make lcov_init`), then run the tests (e.g. `ctest`) and finally generate the report
# with the lcov_report target (e.g. `make lcov_report`). If you only need the evaluated coverage
# data, but no HTML report, build the `lcov_eval` target instead.
