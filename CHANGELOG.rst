Notable project changes since release 1.3.1 (2017-02-22).


Unreleased
==========

Added
-----

- Generalization of mixers to also handle complex density matrices

- General range-separated, long-range corrected CAM hybrid functionals for
  ground-state periodic systems (MPI-parallel Fock-type exchange and energy
  gradient construction by neighbour-list and matrix-multiplication based
  algorithms)

- Generalization of non-periodic, ground-state LC-DFTB Hamiltonian to general
  range-separated, long-range corrected CAM hybrid functionals
  (MPI-parallelization of matrix-multiplication based Fock-type exchange
  construction, MPI-parallel matrix-multiplication based energy gradient
  evaluation, restart of matrix-multiplication based hybrid-DFTB calculations)

- Electronic constraints on arbitrary regions, targeting the electronic ground
  state by determining a self-consistent constraint potential (restricted to
  Mulliken populations at the moment)

- Density Matrix construction on GPU using MAGMA-BLAS routines

- More control over output of data and band structures during MD
  calculations

Fixed
-----

- SK-file parser extra-/spline-tag sequence dependent

  linear-response TD-DFTB calculations.

  is not formally derived in the general case.

=================

Added
-----

Fixed
-----
