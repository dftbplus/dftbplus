18.1 (2018-03-02)
=================

Added
-----

- MPI-parallelism.

- Various user settings for MPI-parallelism.

- Improved thread-parallelism.

- LBGFS geometry driver.

- Evaluation of electrostatic potentials at specified points in space.

- Blurred external charges for periodic systems.

- Option to read/write restart charges as ASCII text.

- Timer for collecting timings and printing them at program end.

- Tolerance of Ewald summation can be set in user input.

- Shutdown possibility when using socket driver.

- Header for code prints release / git commit version information.

- Warning when downloading license incompatible external components.

- Tool straingen for distorting gen-files.


Changed
-------

- Using allocatables instead of pointers where possible.

- Change to use the Fypp-preprocessor.

- Excited state (non-force) properties for multiple excitations.

- Broyden-mixer does not use file I/O.

- Source code documentation is Ford-compatible.

- Various refactorings to improve on modularity and code clarity.


Fixed
-----

- Keyword Atoms in modes_in.hsd consider only the first specified entry.

- Excited window selection in Cassida time-dependent calculation.

- Formatting of eigenvalues and fillings in detailed.out and band.out
