Finds the LAPACK library

This is a wrapper around CMakes FindLAPACK module with the additional
possibility to customize the library name manually. In latter case the module will
check the existence of those libraries and stop if they are not found.

Note: The module is named FindLapack (and not FindLAPACK) to avoid name
collision with CMakes built-in FindLAPACK module.


Imported Targets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module provides the following imported target, if found:

``LAPACK::LAPACK``
  The LAPACK library


Result Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module will define the following variable:

``LAPACK_FOUND``
  True if the system has the LAPACK library


Cache variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following cache variables may be set to influence the library detection:

``LAPACK_DETECTION``
  Whether LAPACK libraries should be detected (default: True). If set to False,
  the settings in ``LAPACK_LIBRARY`` will be used without any further checks.

``LAPACK_LIBRARY``
  Customized LAPACK library/libraries to use (instead of autodetected ones).  If
  no LAPACK library is required (e.g. the linker automatically links it) set
  ``LAPACK_LIBRARY="NONE"``. If not set or empty, the built-in LAPACK finder
  (the findLAPACK module) will be invoked. Otherwise, the listed libraries
  will be checked for existence (unless disabled in ``LAPACK_DETECTION``) and
  the variable is overwritten to contain the libraries with their with full
  path.

``LAPACK_LIBRARY_DIR``
  Directories which should be looked up in order to find the customized libraries.

``LAPACK_LINKER_FLAG``
  Flags to use when linking LAPACK

Additionally, the cache variables of the built-in FindLAPACK modules may used to
influence the LAPACK detection if the built-in module is invoked.
