Contains both the functions that transmit data to the socket and read the data
back out again once finished, and the function which opens the socket initially.
Can be linked to a FORTRAN code that does not support sockets natively.

Functions:
   error: Prints an error message and then exits.
   open_socket_: Opens a socket with the required host server, socket type and
      port number.
   write_buffer_: Writes a string to the socket.
   read_buffer_: Reads data from the socket.
