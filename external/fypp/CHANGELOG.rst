3.0
===

Added
-----

* Implement variable keyword argument in macros.

* Add block / contains / endblock construct as alternative for call / nextarg /
  endcall.
  
* Escaping of preprocessor comments

* Possibility of specifying character encoding for file I/O with UTF-8 as
  default.


Changed
-------

* Injecting local variables into macros by passing arbitrary (non-declared)
  keyword arguments is not possible any more. This feature made it impossible to
  detect typos in keyword argument names in macro calls. [Backwards
  incompatible]

* Variable positional argument in a macro resolves to a list not to a tuple for
  more consistency with Python.


Fixed
-----

* Wrong command-line parser initialisation in waf frontend.

* _LINE_ and _FILE_ were incorrect if the called macro contained a call
  directive with an evaluation in its argument.


2.1.1
=====

Fixed
-----

* Wrong _LINE_ and _FILE_ values when calling a macro during evaluation of the
  arguments of a call directive.


2.1
===

Fixed
-----

* Variable definition without value.


Changed
-------

* Hosting site and branch names (develop -> master, master -> release).

-------

* Setvar directive not allowed as alternative to set any more. [Backwards

* Minimal API change: process_* methods of Fypp do not accept the optional

* Equal sign must be used as separator in set directive for better
  readability. [Backwards incompatible]

* Function setvar() accepts arbitrary number of argument pairs.

* Reverse order exception printing, exception first occuring printed as last.

* Command line tool formats error messages in GNU-like format.

* Make equal sign in set directive mandatory and in setvar directive forbidden.

* Search paths for module imports behave more Python-like.

* Removed builtins callable() and memoryview() from restricted environment as they
  are not available in all supported Python versions.
