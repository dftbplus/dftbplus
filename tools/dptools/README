DPTOOLS: Processing and converting data related to the DFTB+ package
********************************************************************

This package contains a few scripts which should make the life of
DFTB+ users easier by providing functions to process and convert
various DFTB+ data formats. It currently contains the following
utilities:

dp_bands
  Creates plotable band structure data from band.out

dp_dos
  Creates plotable density of states or partial density of states data
  by convolving the data produced by DFTB+ with (usually) gaussian
  broadening functions.

gen2cif
  Converts a file in gen format to cif, which contains information
  about the periodic boundary conditions. Among others, Jmol is
  capable of visualising cif files.

gen2xyz
  Converts a file in gen format to xyz in order to visualise it with
  practically all available molecular visualisers.

xyz2gen
  Converts an xyz file to gen file.

Each script can be invoked with the option ``-h`` to obtain a short
summary about its usage and possible options.


Installation
============

Please note, that the package needs at least **Python 2.6** or
later. It should also work with Python 3.X. It additionally needs
Numerical Python (the numpy module).

System install
--------------

You can install the script package via the standard 'python setup'
mechanism. If you want to install it system-wide into your normal
python installation, you simply issue::

  python setup.py

Local install
-------------

Alternatively, you can install it locally in your home space, e.g.::

  python setup.py install --user

If the local python install directory is not in your path, you should
add this. For the bash shell you should include in .bashrc::

  export PATH=$PATH:/home/user/.local/bin

while in tcsh shell, you would have to add to your .cshrc::

  setenv PATH $PATH:/home/user/.local/bin
