PYTHONAPI: A ctypes based Python interface for DFTB+
****************************************************

This package provides a Python Interface for DFTB+ to improve
the ease of use and expand its applications and functionality.
It currently contains the following Python class:

DftbPlus
  Interface module for the communication between DFTB+ and
  Python (via the foreign function C-library ctypes). Provides
  methods for initializing and configuring a DFTB+ calculator.


Compiling DFTB+
===============

In order to be able to use the Python interface, DFTB+ has to get
compiled as a shared library and with API support enabled. To
instruct DFTB+ that a dynamically linked shared library should be
created, the WITH_API and BUILD_SHARED_LIBS flag in the cmake
configuration file config.cmake must be set to TRUE, before starting
the compilation process. If you do not want to mess around with files,
a construct like the following is a convenient way to specify these
flags, while configuring CMake:

cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=1 -DWITH_API=1 \
-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../sys/gnu.cmake ..


Testing pythonapi
=================

In the _build/ directory, running

ctest -R pyapi_*

will validate the source of pythonapi by executing regression tests.

For developers
--------------

To perform pylint static checking, in the top DFTB+ directory the
individual files can be tested, for example by

pylint3 --rcfile utils/srccheck/pylint/pylintrc-3.ini tools/pythonapi/src/*


Installation
============

Please note, that the package has been tested for **Python 3.X**
support. It additionally needs Numerical Python (the numpy module).

System install
--------------

You can install the script package via the standard 'python setup'
mechanism. If you want to install it system-wide into your normal
python installation, you simply issue::

  python setup.py

Local install
-------------

Alternatively, you can install it locally in your home space, e.g.::

  python setup.py install --user

If the local python install directory is not in your path, you should
add this. For the bash shell you should include in .bashrc::

  export PATH=$PATH:/home/user/.local/bin

while in tcsh shell, you would have to add to your .cshrc::

  setenv PATH $PATH:/home/user/.local/bin
