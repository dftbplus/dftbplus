DPTOOLS: Processing and converting data related to the DFTB+ package
********************************************************************

This package contains a few scripts which should make the life of DFTB+ users
easier, by providing functions to process and convert various DFTB+ data
formats. It contains currently the following utilities:

dp_bands
  Creates plottable band structure data from band.out

dp_dos
  Creates plottable density of states or partial density of states data by
  convolving the data produced by DFTB+ with gaussian broadening functions.

gen2cif
  Converts a file in gen format to cif, which contains informations about
  the periodic boundary conditions. Among others, Jmol is capable
  to visualize cif files.

gen2xyz
  Converts a file in gen format to xyz in order to visualize it with practically
  all available molecular visualizers.

xyz2gen
  Converts an xyz file to gen file.

Each script can be invoked with the option ``-h`` to obtain a short summary
about its usage and possible options.


Installation
============

Please note, that the package needs at least **Python 2.6** or later. It should
also work with Python 3.X. It additionally needs Numerical Python (the numpy
module).

You can install the script package via the standard 'python setup'
mechanism. If you want to install it system-wide into your normal python
installation, you simply issue::

  python setup.py

Alternatively, you can install it into a separate directory by specifying an
appropriate installation path as prefix, e.g.::

  python setup.py --prefix /home/user/dptools

In latter case make sure that your environment variable ``$PYTHONPATH``
contains the appropriate directory for the package and ``$PATH`` contains the
path to the binaries. In bash-shell you would have to issue::

  export PATH=$PATH:/home/user/dptools/bin
  export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/user/dptools/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages

while in tcsh shell you would have to execute::

  setenv PATH $PATH:/home/user/dptools/bin
  setenv PYTHONPATH $PYTHONPATH:/home/user/dptools/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages

The letters X.Y stay for your python version (e.g. 2.6). If the last command
fails because there is no PYTHONPATH defined in your sytem yet, issue::

  setenv PYTHONPATH /home/user/dptools/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages

instead. You may put those commands in your initialization files ``.bashrc`` or
``.cshrc`` as well, so that you do not have to enter them explicitely.
