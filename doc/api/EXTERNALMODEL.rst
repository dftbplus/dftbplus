Supplying external models to DFTB+
==================================

Use from within DFTB+::

  Model = External {

  }

Will use the externally declared model

Building
--------

Internally a toy model can be used, but if an external library is
provided in the configuration step (as a cmake argument to
statically/dynamically link a conforming external library) the
resulting libdftbplus or dftb+ can use the external model to generate
the hamiltonian or energy terms.

Model Units
-----------

All units are assumed to be atomic.


Declaring model capabilities
----------------------------

Initialising the model
----------------------

Updating the model
------------------

DFTB+ generates atom and bond-centred clusters surrounding the on-site
and diatomic parts of the model. Both types of cluster are surrounded
by `bystaner` atoms out to the `environment` cutoff (either around the
atom, or the bond vector between the atoms in the dimer). The dimers
of lengths of up to the `interaction` cutoff are generated.

In the special case of an environmentally independent model (i.e. the
environment cluster is of length 0), only individual atoms and pairs
of atoms will be generated.
