\chapter{PHONONS}

The tool PHONONS allows to perform quantum thermal transport calculations \cite{phonontool}. 
The quantities that can be computed are phonon transmission function and, hence, 
the thermal conductance. The non-equilibrium Green's function formalism for phonon transport was used.
Currently only coherent transport is possible based on a dynamical matrix.
Phonon dispersion of materials can also be computed using this tool, based on a supercell geometry.
A suitable supercell for phonon dispersions can be constructed using dptools.

The input file must be named \verb|phonons_in.hsd| and should be a 
Human-friendly Structured Data (HSD) formatted file (see Appendix \ref{sec:hsd}).

\section{Phonon transport calculation}

The input file has a similar structure to that defined for electron transport calculations and for the
calculation of phonon modes (see Chapters \ref{app:modes} and \ref{app:transp}). 

The table below contains the relevant blocks in the input file, 

\begin{ptableh}
  \kw{Geometry} & p|m &  & - & \pref{sec:dftbp.Geometry} \\
  \kw{Transport} & p|m &  & - & \pref{sec:phonon.Transport} \\
  \kw{Masses} & p|m &  & - &  \\
  \kw{Hessian} & p & & \cb & \pref{sec:phonon.Hessian} \\
  \kw{Analysis} &p|m&  & - & \pref{sec:phonon.Analysis} \\
\end{ptableh}


\begin{description}
\item[\is{Geometry}] Specifies the geometry for the system to be calculated. 
	Follow the steps described in Section \ref{sec:transport.geometry} for a proper generation 
	of the geometry file to compute transport properties. Also use the tool SETUPGEOM.
\item[\is{Transport}] Contains the description of the partitioning of the system into a 
	{\em device} and {\em contact} regions and additional information needed to calculate the 
	required self-energies associated with the contacts. 
	See Section 4.2 and p.~\pref{sec:phonon.Transport}.
\item[\is{Masses}]  Specifies the mass of atoms in the geometry file. 
	Default values are the standard atomic weights of the chemical elements. Alternatively
	it is possible to insert them manually or read thenm from the Slater-Koster files.
\item[\is{Hessian}] Contains information about the second derivatives matrix of the system energy 
	with respect to atomic positions. See  p.~\pref{sec:phonon.Hessian}.
\item[\is{Analysis}] This block is used to introduce the parameters for the calculation of 
	phonon transport properties: phonon transmission, (total and projected) density of states, 
	and thermal conductance. See  p.~\pref{sec:phonon.Analysis}.
\end{description}

\subsection{Transport\{\}}
\label{sec:phonon.Transport}

The common partitioning scheme for phonon transport calculation was used. 
In this block, the atoms considered for the device and contact regions must be specified 
(see Section 4.2). 
The temperature of the contacts is added in the contact sections. 
An example of the transport geometry specification looks like:

\begin{verbatim}
transport {
    device {
      AtomRange = 1 50
    }
    contact {
      Id = "Drain"
      atomrange = 51 100
      temperature [K] = 300.0
    }
    contact {
      Id = "Source"
      atomrange = 101 150
      temperature [K] = 300.0
    }
}
\end{verbatim}

\htcbsubsubsection{Device}

The device block contains the following properties 

\begin{ptable}
  \kw{AtomRange} &2i& & - & \pref{pAtomRange} \\
\end{ptable}

\begin{description}
\item[\is{AtomRange}] \label{pAtomRange} defines the first and last atom of the device region.
\end{description}

\htcbsubsubsection{Contact}

The contact block contains the following properties:

\begin{ptable}
  \kw{Id} & s &  & &  \\
  \kw{AtomRange} &2i& &  &  \\
  \kw{PLShiftTolerance} & r & & 1E-5 & \\
  \kw{Temperature} & r & & 0.0 & \\
\end{ptable}

\begin{description}
\item[\is{Id}] Assign a text label to the contact (must be 50 or fewer characters).
\item[\is{AtomRange}]  Defines the first and last atom of the
  device region.  {\bf Note} the contacts should be defined such that the atoms
  included in the range are in continuous increasing order in the structure.
\item[\is{PLShiftTolerance}]\modif{\modtype{length}} Used to set the absolute
  accuracy used to check principal layer (PL) consistency (see above). The
  default is $10^{-5}$ atomic units. Please be aware that using a large values
  may hide errors due to an inconsistent definition of the contacts, therefore
  it should not be modified.
\item[\is{Temperature}]\modif{\modtype{temperature}} Specifies the temperature of the contact. 
	For two contact calculations, if temperature of the contacts are different then a heat flux 
	will be computed.
\end{description}

\subsection{Hessian\{\}}
\label{sec:phonon.Hessian}

The Hessian matrix is at the core of the calculation. 
It contains the second derivatives\index{Hessian} of the energy,
	
$$\frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial x_{i1} \partial x_{i1}} \frac{\partial^2
  E}{\partial x_{j1} \partial x_{i1}} \frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial x_{k1}
  \partial x_{i1}} \frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial x_{i2} \partial x_{i1}}
\frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial x_{j2} \partial x_{i1}} \frac{\partial^2
  E}{\partial x_{k2} \partial x_{i1}} \ldots \frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial x_{kn}
  \partial x_{kn}}$$

The Hessian matrix can be supplied by {\dftbp}, see p.~\pref{sec:dftbp.SecondDerivatives} 
The derivatives matrix must be stored as the following order: For the $i$, $j$ and $k$
directions of atoms $1 \ldots n$.
The tool PHONONS can also read other formats of Hessians computed with other tools. 
Currently Gaussian and CP2K are implemented.

The table below contains the list of properties which may be present in this block:

\begin{ptable}
  \kw{Cutoff} & r &  & 0.0 &  \\
  \kw{Matrix} & p & & \cb & \\
\end{ptable}

An example of the Hessian specification looks like:

\begin{verbatim}
Hessian {
   Cutoff = 50.0 
   Matrix = dftb{
	    <<<hessian.out
    }
}
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}

\item[\is{Cutoff}] Specifies the range of interacting atoms in atomic units.
\item[\iscb{Matrix}] Contains the second derivatives\index{Hessian} of the energy.

{\em Note}: for supercell calculations, the phonon transmission is obtained at the $\mathbf{q}=0$ 
point, irrespective of the k-point sampling used to compute the Hessian.
 
\end{description} 


\subsection{Analysis\{\}}
\label{sec:phonon.Analysis}

The analysis block looks like:

\begin{verbatim}
Analysis {
  TunnelingAndDOS{
    FreqRange = 1e-6 1e-2
    FreqStep = 4e-5
    Delta = 6e-4

    Region = {
      Atoms = 1:50
    }
  }

  Conductance{
    TempRange [K] = 1.0 802.0
    TempStep [K] = 1.0
  }
}
\end{verbatim}  

\htcbsubsubsection{TunnelingAndDOS}

This method block is used to calculate the transmission by means of the Caroli formula in terms of the phonon Green's functions of the device and the self-energies of the contacts. The density of states is also computed from the spectral function. This block can only be specified if an open boundary conditions system has been defined in \is{Transport} (see p.\pref{Transport}).

\begin{ptable}
  \kw{FreqRange} & 2r &  & &  \\
  \kw{FreqStep} & r & &  &  \\
  \kw{Delta} & r & & & \\
  \kw{Region} & p & & \cb & \pref{pRegion} \\
\end{ptable}

\begin{description}
\item[\is{FreqRange}]\modif{\modtype{energy}} Contains the frequency range over
  which the transmission function and local density of states are computed.
\item[\is{FreqStep}]\modif{\modtype{energy}} Is the frequency sampling step for
  evaluating properties.
\item[\is{Delta}]\modif{\modtype{energy}} Defines the imaginary frequency value 
	for the phonon Green's function.
\item[\iscb{Region}] \label{pRegion} This block defines atomic ranges on to which the  
	density of states is projected. 
	The definition in the block follow the same syntax as a \dftbp{} calculation without 
	transport (see section~\ref{sec:dftbp.ProjectStates}).
\end{description}

\htcbsubsubsection{Conductance}

This method block is used to calculate the thermal conductance by means of the Landauer formula.

\begin{ptable}
  \kw{TempRange} & 2r &  & &  \\
  \kw{TempStep} & r & &  &  \\
\end{ptable}

\begin{description}

  which the thermal conductance is computed.
\item[\is{TempStep}]\modif{\modtype{temperature}} Is the temperature sampling step for
  evaluating the thermal conductance.
\end{description}


\section{Phonon dispersion}

In order to compute phonon dispersions the following steps must be followed. 
1. Start from a bulk cell and generate a suitable supercell using dptools. 
This supercell must have the central cell at the beginning and then the repeated cells must follow a 
specific loop order over the supercell vectors. 
2. Compute the Hessian for all atoms of this supercell.
3. Run PHONONS for bandstructure calculations.

The relevant sections in the input file are:
\begin{ptableh}
  \kw{Geometry} & p|m &  & - & \pref{sec:dftbp.Geometry} \\
  \kw{PhononDispersion} & p|m &  & - & \pref{sec:phonon.Transport} \\
  \kw{Masses} & p|m &  & - &  \\
  \kw{Hessian} & p & & \cb & \pref{sec:phonon.Hessian} \\
\end{ptableh}

\begin{description}
\item[\is{nAtomUnitCell}] Specifies the number of atoms in the unit cell. 
\item[\iscb{KPoints}] Defines the k-point path for the phonon dispersion. 
\end{description} 

The file of kpoints must be in the following format,

...
\end{verbatim}
