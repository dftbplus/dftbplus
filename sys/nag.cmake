# NAG Fortran compiler, GNU C compiler
#
# Notes:
#
#  * CMake format: Command line options (e.g. compiler flags) space separated, other kind
#    of lists semicolon separated.
#
#  * Variables containing library search paths are empty by default. The CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
#    environment variable should be set up correctly, so that CMake can find those libraries
#    automatically. If that is not the case, override those variables to add search paths
#    manually

# External libraries
#

# NOTE: Libraries with CMake export files (e.g. ELSI and if the HYBRID_CONFIG_METHODS variable
# contains the "Find" method also libNEGF, libMBD, ScalapackFx and MpiFx) are included by searching
# for the export file in the paths defined in the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH **environment** variable. Make
# sure your CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH variable is set up accordingly.

# LAPACK and BLAS
#set(LAPACK_LIBRARY "openblas" CACHE STRING "LAPACK and BLAS libraries to link")
#set(LAPACK_LIBRARY_DIR "" CACHE STRING
#  "Directories where LAPACK and BLAS libraries can be found")

# ARPACK -- only needed when built with ARPACK support
#set(ARPACK_LIBRARY "arpack" CACHE STRING "Arpack library")
#set(ARPACK_LIBRARY_DIR "" CACHE STRING "Directories where Arpack library can be found")

#set(SCALAPACK_LIBRARY "scalapack" CACHE STRING "Scalapack libraries to link")
#set(SCALAPACK_LIBRARY_DIR "" CACHE STRING
#  "Directories where Scalapack libraries can be found")

# NOTE: The libraries below provide Pkg-Conf export files.  If your PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment
# variable has been set up correctly (containing the paths to these libraries), no adjustment should
# be necessary below.

# PLUMED -- only needed when compiled with PLUMED support
