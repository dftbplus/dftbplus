#
# Toolchain file for
#
# NAG Fortran compiler, GNU C compiler
#
# Notes:
#
#  * CMake format: Command line options (e.g. compiler flags) space separated, other kind
#    of lists semicolon separated.
#
#  * Variables containing library search paths are empty by default. The CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
#    environment variable should be set up correctly, so that CMake can find those libraries
#    automatically. If that is not the case, override those variables to add search paths
#    manually
#
#  * Compiler flags specified via the environment variables FFLAGS and CFLAGS are *appended* to the
#    pre-configured flags. If you want to override all flags on the command line, use the
#    -DFortran_FLAGS=<flags> and -DC_FLAGS=<flags> options.
